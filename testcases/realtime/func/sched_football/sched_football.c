 * NAME
 *      sched_football.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      This is a scheduler test that uses a football analogy.
 *      The premise is that we want to make sure that lower priority threads
 *      don't run while we have runnable higher priority threads.
 *      The offense is trying to increment the balls position, while the
 *      defense is trying to block that from happening.
 *      And the ref (highest priority thread) will blow the wistle if the
 *      ball moves. Finally, we have crazy fans (higer prority) that try to
 *      distract the defense by occasionally running onto the field.
 *
 *      Steps:
 *       - Create NR_CPU offense threads (lower priority)
 *       - Create NR_CPU defense threads (mid priority)
 *       - Create 2*NR_CPU fan threads (high priority)
 *       - Create a referee thread (highest priority)
 *       - Once everyone is on the field, the offense thread spins incrementing
 *         the value of 'the_ball'. The defense thread tries to block the ball
 *         by never letting the offense players get the CPU (it just spins).
 *         The crazy fans sleep a bit, then jump the rail and run across the
 *         field, disrupting the players on the field.
 *       - The refree threads wakes up regularly to check if the game is over :)
 *       - In the end, if the value of 'the_ball' is >0, the test is considered
 *         to have failed.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *      Use run_auto.sh script in current directory to build and run test.

 * HISTORY
 *     2006-03-16 Reduced verbosity, non binary failure reporting, removal of
 *		crazy_fans thread, added game_length argument by Darren Hart.
 *     2007-08-01 Remove all thread cleanup in favor of simply exiting.Various
 *		bugfixes and cleanups. -- Josh Triplett
 *     2009-06-23 Simplified atomic startup mechanism, avoiding thundering herd
 *		scheduling at the beginning of the game. -- Darren Hart
